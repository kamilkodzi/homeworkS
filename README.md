# Hi, and wellcome in to my homework section.
I called it homework due to the recruitment task. 
So idea was not mine however, this is still my project and i made it with heart ;)
I'm pretty sure here you can find more rocket science than clean code (i`m still growing in my skills).
I made this a based on my knowledge and documentaton. 

## How to run it ?:
Just download the repository and open index.html on your browser.
There is no server needed.
I used bootstrap 4 cdn so you need internet connection for proper run.

If you will need more explanation feel free to ask.
